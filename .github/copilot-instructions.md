# Copilot Instructions for This Repository

## Purpose
These instructions are for GitHub Copilot and any AI assistant generating or reviewing code in this repository. The user is learning about the game development process, so all code generation and review should be educational, beginner-friendly, and well-documented.

## Guidelines for Copilot

1. **Always Add Comments:**
   - For any code you generate, edit, or review, always add clear and concise comments explaining what each part does and why it is needed.
   - Use beginner-friendly language and avoid unexplained jargon.

2. **Explain Reasoning:**
   - When generating or reviewing code, include comments or docstrings that explain the reasoning behind your approach (e.g., performance, readability, maintainability, or best practices).
   - If you fix a bug or error, describe what caused it and how your code resolves it.

3. **Use the Project's Script Template:**
   - For new scripts or helpers, use the TEMPLATE_SCRIPT format found in the project for consistency and clarity.

4. **Highlight Learning Opportunities:**
   - Point out useful GameMaker or general game development concepts as they appear in the code.
   - Encourage exploration and experimentation.

5. **Be Positive and Supportive:**
   - Frame code, comments, and reviews in a constructive, encouraging way.
   - Suggest resources or documentation links if relevant.

6. **Respect Project Structure:**
   - Follow the project's folder and naming conventions.
   - Do not introduce breaking changes without clear explanation and user consent.

**Example Code Comment:**
> // This loop spawns new pops at random positions within the room bounds. The clamp function ensures pops don't spawn off-screen.

**Example Review Comment:**
> "I added comments to this function to explain each step. The loop spawns new pops at random positions, and the clamp function ensures they stay within the room bounds. This approach is common in GameMaker for procedural placement. Let me know if you want to see a visual example!"
