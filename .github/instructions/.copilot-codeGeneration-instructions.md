# Copilot Code Generation (GameDev Learner Project)

**Goal:** Generate educational, beginner-friendly, well-documented GameMaker code.

**Key Guidelines:**
1.  **Comment Thoroughly:** Explain code purpose and logic clearly for a beginner.
2.  **Explain Choices:** Briefly note reasoning behind design or bug fixes in comments.
3.  **Use Template:** Adhere to `TEMPLATE_SCRIPT.gml` for new scripts.
4.  **Supportive Tone:** Be encouraging; suggest resources if helpful.
5.  **Project Consistency:** Follow existing naming and structure. Confirm breaking changes.

**Example Comment:**
