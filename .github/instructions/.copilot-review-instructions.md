# Copilot Code Review (GameDev Learner Project)

**Goal:** Review code to ensure it's educational, beginner-friendly, and well-documented for a GameMaker project.

**Key Review Points:**
1.  **Clarity & Comments:** Are comments clear, concise, and sufficient for a beginner? Is the code's purpose evident?
2.  **Correctness & Best Practices:** Is the code functional? Does it follow GameMaker best practices and project guidelines (e.g., `TEMPLATE_SCRIPT.gml`)?
3.  **Educational Value:** Does the review explain *why* a change is suggested? Does it highlight learning opportunities or GameMaker concepts?
4.  **Supportive Tone:** Is the feedback constructive and encouraging?
5.  **Project Consistency:** Does the code align with existing naming, structure, and formatting?

**Example Review Comment:**
> "This function looks good! I've added a comment to explain the `ds_map_find_value` usage, as it's a common GameMaker pattern for data lookup. Consider renaming `_val` to `_resource_id` for a bit more clarity. Keep up the great work!"
