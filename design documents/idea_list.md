1. A task system to create various procedurally generated "quests" or tasks based on different things like tech, achievements, events, etc. We can have some hard coded, and some generated upon certain conditions being met.
2. When killing a big animal, after a certain number of time if not fully collected, there is a random chance that a message pops up in the announcement box saying "A predator has smelled your kill... Be prepared." or something like that. Then after a certain time after that message, a predator like a Sabertooth or other predator spawns a distance away (outside of the camera view) and makes its way towards the kill to eat it. If there are pops nearby when it gets there, it will attack them before either dragging the carcass away or claiming it and eating it there (which could create a new task in the task system that I came up with.)
3. Chunks system in Gamemaker, keeping the rooms at the size of 1920x1080 and creating a system to generate chunks and smoothly transition in and out of them.
4. A seed system for the player to type in a seed (global variable) that is set before the generation system is completed, and pulls that seed to use for the game.
